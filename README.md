As an alternative you can also try our non-DTD-based validator. Read more on https://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#validation_basics
            5. What is Jigsaw? https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator
                The Jigsaw software provides the Consortium's Java-based Web server. With a modular architecture and full HTTP/1.1 compliance, the Jigsaw server is a premier experimental platform for W3C and the Internet community. The server uses an object-oriented approach when it comes to the storage of files and the processing of incoming requests, making it both more efficient and easily extensible.
